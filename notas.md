== Try-With-Resources
A try-with-resources statement in Java 7 is used to close resources automatically after a try code block. An object that implements the AutoCloseable interface has its `close()` method always called at the try block finalization, it an analog way to the use of a finally clause and similar to a context manager in Python 2 where the `__enter__()` method corresponds to the Java class constructor and the `__exit__()` method corresponds to the method `close()`.

== Nashorn engine

The Nashorn engine that comes with Java 8 isnâ€™t fully compliant with Javascript Harmony because multiline strings has a different syntax turning .js files incompatible with other engines. But provides some scripting advantages via the `-scripting` flag as a syntax to evaluate commands in back-ticks returning its output into a string (e.g. ```echo a` == "a\n"``).

== Interface default methods
Java 8 finally has some sort of multiple inheritance via interface default methods (e.g. `default int m() { return 1; }`). Now classes can "inherit" concrete methods from multiple interfaces, disanbiguation is done implementing it otherwise causing a compilation error. It avoiding complex rules to determine which method implementation will be called but the only difference from inheriting from multiple abstract classes is that interfaces can't have a constructor or a `this` reference.
